Importing from YAML and the database
====================================

One of the most exciting things about the menu framework is the easy with
which you can store and import menu structures. This chapter will show you
how to store menu trees in YAML as well as how to persist and retrieve
them to and from the database via the `ioDoctrineMenuItemPlugin`. As a
bonus, the `ioDoctrineMenuItemPlugin comes with a built-in admin for reordering
and modifying the menu items in the database.

Importing from YAML
-------------------

As explained in the previous chapter, the `ioMenuItem` object can be used
to create entire menu trees from an array input. This makes specifying
menus in YAML extremely easy. Suppose we want to specify an admin menu
in `app.yml`:

    all:
      menus:
        admin_menu:
          name:     Admin menu
          children:
            signin:
              label:   Sign in
              route:   @sf_guard_signin
              requires_no_auth: true
              attributes: {class: signin }
            signout:
              label:   Sign out
              route:   @sf_guard_signout
              requires_auth: true
            user_admin:
              label:          User Admin
              requires_auth: true
              children:
                manage_users:
                  label:   Manage Users
                  route:   @sf_guard_user
                  credentials: [ManageUsers]
                manage_permissions:
                  label:   Manage Permissions
                  route:   @sf_guard_permission
                  credentials: [ManagePermissions]

Creating and rendering a menu item from this object is easy:

    $arr = sfConfig::get('app_menus_admin_menu');
    $menu = ioMenuItem::createFromArray($arr);
    echo $menu->render();

Importing menus from the database
----------------------------------

The `ioDoctrineMenuItem` plugin creates an `ioDoctrineMenuItem` Doctrine
model where multiple menu trees can be saved. This acts as a "data source",
which, like the yaml syntax above, is used to create `ioMenuItem` trees.

Fetching menus from the database is easy. The `ioDoctrineMenuItem` has
multiple roots, each representing an independent menu tree. To create an
`ioMenuItem` tree from the database, simply ask for it via the root menu
items `name` field in the database. For example, suppose we have a root
menu item whose name is `primary`:

    // from an actions file
    $menu = $this->getDoctrineMenu('primary');

    // from the view
    <?php echo get_doctrine_menu('primary')->render() ?>

With one simple line of code, the menu tree with root node named "primary"
is retrieved from the database and transformed into an `ioMenuItem` tree.

Saving menus to the database
----------------------------

Perhaps even more interesting is that any `ioMenuItem` can be persisted
to the database. Each `ioMenuItem` you persist or save will create a new
root node in the `ioDoctrineMenuItem` model.

    $menu = new ioMenuItem('primary');
    $menu->addChild('overview', '@homepage')
      ->setAttributes('class' => 'home');
    $menu->addChild('signin', @signin')
      ->requiresNoAuth(true);

    Doctrine_Core::getTable('ioDoctrineMenuItem')->persist($menu);

That's it! You're entire menu tree was stored as a Nested Set in the
`ioDoctrineMenuItem` model. The root of the nested set will be the entry
named 'primary'.

Caching Doctrine menu trees
---------------------------

Even better, you can easily cache the menu trees so that they're only
pulled from the database the first time. While the cache is setup by
default, you may configure it further in `app.yml`:

    all:
      doctrine_menu:
        cache:
          enabled:  true
          class:    sfFileCache
          options:
            cache_dir:  <?php echo sfConfig::get('sf_app_cache_dir') ?>/io_doctrine_menu

To use the cache, simply fetch your trees using the `ioDoctrineMenuManager`
instead of using the `ioDoctrineMenuItemTable::fetchMenu()` method directly.
To do this, you'll first need to get an instance of `ioDoctrineMenuPluginConfiguration`.
While this will be made easier in the future
[http://redmine.sympalphp.org/issues/110](#110)
[http://redmine.sympalphp.org/issues/111](#111), this can be done fairly
easily from the actions class:

    public function executeIndex(sfWebRequest $request)
    {
      $this->menu = $this->getContext()
        ->getConfiguration()
        ->getPluginConfiguration('ioDoctrineMenuPlugin')
        ->getMenuManager()
        ->getMenu('admin');
    }

By enabling cache in `app.yml` and retrieving your doctrine menus using
the menu manager, all the menus will be retrieved from the database only
once and then cached. If a menu item is updated in the database, the menu
cache is automatically flushed.

Draggable, sortable admin interface
-----------------------------------

Another perk of the `ioDoctrineMenuPlugin` is that it comes packaged with
an admin interface where the admin user can easily reorder and reorganize the
menus.
